\title{Proposed AUM (Area Under Minimum)}
\usage{
PR_AUM(pred_tensor, label_tensor)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred_tensor}{A 1D [torch::torch_tensor] of real-valued prediction
scores (higher values indicate stronger evidence for the positive class).}

\item{label_tensor}{A 1D [torch::torch_tensor] of true class labels,
encoded as `-1` for the negative class and `+1` for the positive class.}
}
\value{
A scalar [torch::torch_tensor] containing the proposed AUM value.
}
\description{
Computes the proposed Area Under the Curve of the minimum between
False Discovery Rate (FDR) and False Negative Rate (FNR), based on
the precision-recall curve.
}
\details{
This measure integrates the minimum of FDR and FNR across
threshold intervals induced by prediction scores.
